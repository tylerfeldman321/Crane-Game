2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance WRAPPER/InstMem/dataOut_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.033 ns between WRAPPER/CPU/XM_IR_reg/loop1[31].dff/q_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and WRAPPER/CPU/PC_reg/loop1[15].dff/q_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.047 ns between WRAPPER/CPU/XM_IR_reg/loop1[31].dff/q_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and WRAPPER/CPU/PC_reg/loop1[12].dff/q_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.066 ns between WRAPPER/CPU/XM_IR_reg/loop1[31].dff/q_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and WRAPPER/CPU/PC_reg/loop1[11].dff/q_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.082 ns between WRAPPER/CPU/XM_IR_reg/loop1[31].dff/q_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and WRAPPER/CPU/PC_reg/loop1[2].dff/q_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.094 ns between WRAPPER/CPU/XM_IR_reg/loop1[31].dff/q_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and WRAPPER/CPU/PC_reg/loop1[16].dff/q_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.097 ns between WRAPPER/CPU/XM_IR_reg/loop1[31].dff/q_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and WRAPPER/CPU/PC_reg/loop1[14].dff/q_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.107 ns between WRAPPER/CPU/XM_IR_reg/loop1[31].dff/q_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and WRAPPER/CPU/PC_reg/loop1[5].dff/q_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
