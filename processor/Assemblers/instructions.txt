This program can assemble ECE350 limited-ISA MIPS assembly into machine code. 

== Choosing which executable to use
We have compiled the assembler for all of the major operating systems for you to use. You can move the compiled file from the operating system folder into the top assembler folder.

You can move the file using the Finder or File Explorer applications on your computer or use the command line.

For example: 
If you are using a windows computer, move the file from ./windows/asm to ./asm

If you are using a Mac made after 2020, you can use the cp command to move the assembler using the following command:

	cp ./mac_m1/asm ./ 


== Using the program

asm [flags] <filename>

Args:
<filename>  name of the assembly file to assemble

Optional Flags:
-o      name of the output file
-i      csv file containing custom instruction definitions
-r      csv file containing custom register aliases
-b      output base of instructions (only 2 or 16 supported). Defaults to binary.
-l      number of 32-bit words in output file

== Custom Instructions

Custom instructions should be defined in a .csv file. Each row specifies a single instruction 
and should match the following format: instruction, type, opcode.

For example:

print,J,11000
draw,R,11001

== Custom Register Aliases

You can define additional register aliases in another .csv file. The first column of the row
defines which register to assign aliases and following columns are all assigned as aliases.

For example:
2,sprite
3,reg3
3,register3
3,three

This will set "sprite" to be an alias for register 2 and "reg3", "register3", and "three"
to be aliases for register 3. Then these aliases can be used in the assembly files in place of the
register number.

add $three, $sprite, $reg3 <==> add $3, $2, $3
