# ECE 350 Project - Crane Game
Project built for ECE 350. Used processor we built and uploaded to an FPGA to add up score and keep track of time remaining and whether the game was active. Used two arduinos to control motors to rotate a small crane, raise and lower an electromagnet, and use a relay to power the electromagnet to pick up boxes. The boxes could be dropped into an acyrlic case and detected by a sound sensor, which would communicate to the FPGA to increment the score. A start button was used to reset the score and the timer.
